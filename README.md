## Notesapp
### About Project:
This project all about personal note taking app which i made using HTML, CSS and javascript. For hosting I have used Azure Static web app, 
Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository So, I hosted using this service.

##### Following are some key features of Azure Static Web Apps that made me choose this service:

1. Authentication provider integrations with Azure Active Directory, GitHub, and Twitter.
2. Customizable authorization role definition and assignments.
3. Back-end routing rules enabling full control over the content and routes you serve.
4. Generated staging versions powered by pull requests enabling preview versions of your site before publishing.
5. Web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
6. Integrated API support provided by Azure Functions with the option to link an existing Azure Functions app using a standard account.
7. First-class GitHub and Azure DevOps integration where repository changes trigger builds and deployments.
8. Globally distributed static content, putting content closer to your users.
